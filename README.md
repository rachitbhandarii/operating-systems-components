# Operating Systems Components
> Custom ELF Loader, Unix Shell, Process Scheduler, and Multithreader from scratch in C.
> Helps users load 32-bit executables in Linux without using any API calls and uses least amount of memory by implementing paging, execute commands through a custom light-weight shell, with in-built priority process scheduling and handling of daemon background processes, compute faster using automated multithreading algorithms
